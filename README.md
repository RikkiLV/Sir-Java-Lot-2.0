We've got a Knight, let's fight this knight.

A use case is a commonly utilized tool in software engineering. In essence, it is a description of the interaction between a user and the software to achieve a goal. This description is expressed as a set of steps used to achieve the goal. Let's have a look at our use case for Assignment 4.

The user runs the software program, which warmly welcomes the user to “Knight Fight”.
The user is asked for the Knight's name, which is entered with the keyboard.
The user is asked what weapon this Knight will use, which is entered with the keyboard.
The user is asked for a preference: auto-generate the opponent or manually generate an opponent.
(a) If the user responds “yes”, the software will auto-generate the knight's opponent with randomized attributes.

(b) If the user responds “no”, the user is able to define the name and weapon type of the opponent.

The software will now give each Knight a random number of hit points.
The software now displays a brief summary of each Knight, showing the name, weapon, and hit points.
The software asks the user to press any key when they are ready to begin OR takes a y/n answer to start or exit.
Upon receiving the key, the software randomly chooses which Knight shall begin combat.
Each Knight attacks in turn with their chosen weapon, which deals a random amount of damage based upon the weapon type.
The damage dealt is subtracted from the hit points of the opposing Knight.
A brief summary of each round is displayed to the user.
Once a knight's hit points are reduced to zero or less, the fight ends with the Knight with hit points remaining declared the winner.
